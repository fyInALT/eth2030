## Post-Quantum Roadmap Alignment

Based on Vitalik's quantum resistance roadmap (Feb 27, 2026), eth2030 addresses all 4 vulnerable areas:

| Vulnerable Area | Solution | Package |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| CL BLS Signatures | STARK-aggregated Dilithium sigs | `pkg/consensus/stark_sig_aggregation.go` |
| DA KZG Commitments | Lattice-based blob commitments (MLWE) | `pkg/crypto/pqc/lattice_blob.go` |
| EOA ECDSA Signatures | EIP-8141 frame txs + PQ registry | `pkg/core/`, `pkg/crypto/pqc/registry.go` |
| Application-layer Proofs | Recursive STARK mempool aggregation | `pkg/proofs/stark_prover.go`, `pkg/txpool/stark_aggregation.go` |

Key infrastructure:
- **Pluggable hash backend**: Keccak256, SHA-256, BLAKE3 (Poseidon2 future)
- **STARK prover**: FRI-based over Goldilocks field (p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1)
- **NTT precompile**: EIP-7885 aligned, BN254 + Goldilocks fields
- **500ms mempool ticks**: STARK aggregate of all validated transactions

See [PQ Roadmap Report](PQ_ROADMAP_REPORT.md) for full details.

## Key EIPs

- **EIP-7732**: Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS)
- **EIP-7885**: NTT precompile for lattice crypto and STARKs
- **EIP-7928**: Parallel EVM execution via access lists
- **EIP-4844**: Blob transactions with KZG commitments
- **EIP-7594**: PeerDAS (data availability sampling)
- **EIP-7702**: Set code for EOAs (native account abstraction)
- **EIP-7805**: FOCIL (fork-choice enforced inclusion lists)
- **EIP-8079**: Native rollups (EXECUTE precompile)
- **EIP-8141**: Frame transactions (programmable tx validation)
- **EIP-7251**: Increase MAX_EFFECTIVE_BALANCE (flexible staking)
- **EIP-4444**: History expiry (bound historical data retrieval)
